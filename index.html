		<p> I'm from a refugee camp in Thailand. I didn't speak any English at all when I first came to America. I'm currently a senior at Washington High School. I like to play soccer. I have ACE class every Saturday. I dont't like math even though I'm in AP cal. I like learning new things, that is why I'm here in this workshop. </p>
